<!-- This was pretty straight forward, I didn't feel the need to code along for this one. I'm just going to do the task. -->

<!-- Notice the difference between all caps and the font-variant: small-caps. the text is lowercase in the html, the css turns it all capitals approx the height of lower case letters. -->
